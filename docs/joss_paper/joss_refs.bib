abstract = {Steepest descent methods combining complex contour deformation with numerical quadrature provide an efficient and accurate approach for the evaluation of highly oscillatory integrals. However, unless the phase function governing the oscillation is particularly simple, their application requires a significant amount of a priori analysis and expert user input, to determine the appropriate contour deformation, and to deal with the non-uniformity in the accuracy of standard quadrature techniques associated with the coalescence of stationary points (saddle points) with each other, or with the endpoints of the original integration contour. In this paper we present a novel algorithm for the numerical evaluation of oscillatory integrals with general polynomial phase functions, which automates the contour deformation process and avoids the difficulties typically encountered with coalescing stationary points and endpoints. The inputs to the algorithm are simply the phase and amplitude functions, the endpoints and orientation of the original integration contour, and a small number of numerical parameters. By a series of numerical experiments we demonstrate that the algorithm is accurate and efficient over a large range of frequencies, even for examples with a large number of coalescing stationary points and with endpoints at infinity. As a particular application, we use our algorithm to evaluate cuspoid canonical integrals from scattering theory. A Matlab implementation of the algorithm is made available and is called PathFinder.}

abstract = {We introduce a new method for evaluating the oscillatory integrals which describe natural interference patterns. As an illustrative example of contemporary interest, we consider astrophysical plasma lensing of coherent sources like pulsars and fast radio bursts in radio astronomy. Plasma lenses are known to occur near the source, in the interstellar medium, as well as in the solar wind and the earth’s ionosphere. Such lensing is strongest at long wavelengths, hence it is generally important to go beyond geometric optics and into the full wave optics regime. Our computational method is a spinoff of new techniques two of us, and our collaborators, have developed for defining and performing Lorentzian path integrals with applications in quantum mechanics, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. Cauchy’s theorem allows one to transform a computationally fragile and expensive, highly oscillatory integral into an exactly equivalent sum of absolutely and rapidly convergent integrals which can be evaluated in polynomial time. We require only that it is possible to analytically continue the lensing phase, expressed in the integrated coordinates, into the complex domain. We give a first-principles derivation of the Fresnel–Kirchhoff integral, starting from Feynman’s path integral for a massless particle in a refractive medium. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by computing the detailed diffraction patterns of Thom’s caustic catastrophes, both in their “normal forms” and within a variety of more realistic, local lens models, for all wavelengths. Our numerical method, implemented in a freely downloadable code, provides a fast, accurate tool for modeling interference patterns in radioastronomy and other fields of physics.}
