# API-level function documentation

In this chapter, we summarise the I/O of all Matlab and code underpinning PathFinder. Below is a list of all Matlab and files used in PathFinder (excluding example files).

In the description of each subroutine, we use similar notation as in {cite:p}`PFpaper`, where further description can be found.

For the C code used to generate the MEX functions, detailed information about inputs and outputs can be found in the comments of the `.c` and `.h` files.
